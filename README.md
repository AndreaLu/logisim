Digital logic simulation for python, just for fun!
The simulation is carried out in unit intervals or steps, and all basic logic gates have a propagation delay of one step.

Logic circuits are crafted with logic gates and nets or vectors (arrays of nets).
Logic circuits can be embedded in more complex cells which can be again embedded in bigger ones, and so on.

This project demonstrates that it is possible to do comprehensive logic simulations with a simple algorithm (only about 100 lines of code), starting from basic logic gates, and including non idealities like propagation delay and circuit malfunctioning due to setup or hold violations.
